/**
 * Defines a sample consumer<br>
 * <p>
 * A sample consumer is meant to consume samples in order to process them.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A sample consumer can consume samples on different channels and each channel
 * is assigned a single metadata structure.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A sample consumer is passive, meaning that its <code>consume()</code> service
 * must be called by a third party object.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Sample metadata must be provided to the consumer before
 * <code>startConsuming()</code> is called.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The following sequence must be observed when consuming samples :
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Call <code>setConsumedMetadata()</code> for each channel that will consume
 * samples</li>
 * <li>Call <code>startConsuming()</code> before any call to
 * <code>consume()</code></li>
 * <li>Call <code>consume()</code> for each sample to be consumed by the
 * consumer, specify the channel on which to consume</li>
 * <li>Call <code>stopConsuming()</code> after every sample has been consumed</li>
 * </ul>
