/**
 * An abstract implementation of the JavaSamplerClient interface. This
 * implementation provides default implementations of most of the methods in the
 * interface, as well as some convenience methods, in order to simplify
 * development of JavaSamplerClient implementations.
 * <p>
 * See {@link org.apache.jmeter.protocol.java.test.SleepTest} for an example of
 * how to extend this class.
 * <p>
 * While it may be necessary to make changes to the JavaSamplerClient interface
 * from time to time (therefore requiring changes to any implementations of this
 * interface), we intend to make this abstract class provide reasonable
 * implementations of any new methods so that subclasses do not necessarily need
 * to be updated for new versions. Therefore, when creating a new
 * JavaSamplerClient implementation, developers are encouraged to subclass this
 * abstract class rather than implementing the JavaSamplerClient interface
 * directly. Implementing JavaSamplerClient directly will continue to be
 * supported for cases where extending this class is not possible (for example,
 * when the client class is already a subclass of some other class).
 * <p>
 * The runTest() method of JavaSamplerClient does not have a default
 * implementation here, so subclasses must define at least this method. It may
 * be useful to override other methods as well.
 *
 * @see JavaSamplerClient#runTest(JavaSamplerContext)
